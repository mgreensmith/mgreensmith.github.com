I wear a few professional hats:

- Engineering Manager
- Operations Engineer
- Infrastructure Developer
- Linux Systems Administrator

I'm the Operations Engineering Manager at [Cozy](https://cozy.co/), where I lead the team that owns the performance, reliability and security of our SaaS-based product.

Things that interest me professionally:

- web services
- continuous deployment pipelines
- configuration and data management
- infrastructure as code
- cloud infrastructure
- containerization

I've formerly worked for [AppFog](https://www.appfog.com/), Analog Analytics (acquired by Barclays Bank), and [Renewable Funding](https://renewfund.com).

My favorite tools include Ruby, Chef, bash, Terraform, docker, GoCD, and AWS.
