## Hi, I'm Matt.

I am a herder of boxen - the servers that run your websites. I keep the lights on at [Cozy](https://cozy.co/).

I am an Operations Engineer, a toolsmith developer, a Linux Sysadmin.

I don't differentiate between the 'Ops' and the 'Dev.'

I've recently worked for [AppFog](https://www.appfog.com/), [Analog Analytics](http://analoganalytics.com/), and [Renewable Funding](https://renewfund.com).

I prefer Ruby and [Chef](http://www.getchef.com/).

I like robots. I fly helicopters.

This is my humble website.
