## Hi, I'm Matt.

I am a herder of boxen - the servers that run your websites.

I am an Operations Engineer.

I am a Linux Sysadmin.

I am the 'Ops' and a bit of the 'Dev.'

I've recently worked for [AppFog](https://www.appfog.com/), [Analog Analytics](http://analoganalytics.com/), and [Renewable Funding](https://renewfund.com).

I tinker with Ruby and build stuff with [Chef](http://www.getchef.com/).

I like robots. I fly helicopters.

This is my humble website.
