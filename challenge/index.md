[ No one has solved the puzzle! ]

#### Background
The SaaS QA company [Rainforest](https://www.rainforestqa.com/) used to use a little coding challenge (still available at [letsrevolutionizetesting.com/challenge](http://letsrevolutionizetesting.com/challenge)) as an initial hiring filter for technical candidates. They provided a secret application email address at the end of the challenge. 

I enjoyed their little test so much that I was inspired to create my own little coding challenge/puzzle. It remains unsolved to date (although it's only been available since June 2015). Your name could be at the top of the leaderbaord!
