#### Leaderboard

1. Mike Darke ([@mikedarke](https://twitter.com/mikedarke)) - September 30th, 2015


#### Background
The SaaS QA company [Rainforest](https://www.rainforestqa.com/) used to use a little coding challenge (still available at [letsrevolutionizetesting.com/challenge](http://letsrevolutionizetesting.com/challenge)) as an initial hiring filter for technical candidates. They provided a secret application email address at the end of the challenge. 

I enjoyed their little test so much that I was inspired to create my own little coding challenge/puzzle. ~~It remains unsolved to date (although it's only been available since June 2015). Your name could be at the top of the leaderboard!~~ Huge congratulations to *Mike Darke*, the first person to solve this puzzle!

Solve the puzzle and have your name immortalized on the leaderboard for eternity!
